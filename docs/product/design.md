Reuse the tab system used in scheduler-tester with two tabs:
- chunk tracking
- goal monitoring

# Chunk Tracking

for a specific day:
- display date,
- display chunk list

When in edit mode:
similar to a calendar view with vertical time rule and chunks sized proportionaly to their length, with grabable limits

# Goal Monitoring

instead of displaying a pie chart for defining goal, maybe use correlated sliders - like in the video about the Four Burners Theory (https://youtu.be/sJoR4Hjs3VE). It represents well that if you want balance, you will underperform in every aspects. (eg: if you want to perform well in works, you have to sacrifice health or family or friends & the more you sacrifice, the more you perform). And that priorities change over time.
