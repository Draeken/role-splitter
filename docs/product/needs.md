# Why

We think that it's hard to work alone on a project: we have to handle lots of things from different point of view (multiple hats, like developer, designer, business, etc...). We think it's easier to work on similar things in batch, using one hat, rather than incessantly jungling between different roles. What is though: keeping a balanced life between all these roles.

# How

With simplicity and efficiency

# What

A product to let you split your days in chunks, and associate a role on each chunk - like a time tracker. You can define a Chart goal and compare it to your actual role use, on the 2 last weeks. This way, you can see what roles are underused and plan accordingly.

# Users
