# Why

We think that it's hard to work alone on a project: we have to handle lots of things from different point of view (multiple hats, like developer, designer, business, etc...). We think it's easier to work on similar things in batch, using one hat, rather than incessantly jungling between different roles. What is though: keeping a balanced life between all these roles.

# How

With simplicity and efficiency

# What

A product to let you split your days in chunks, and associate a role on each chunk - like a time tracker. You can define a Chart goal and compare it to your actual role use, on the 2 last weeks. This way, you can see what roles are underused and plan accordingly.

# Users

In a first time: me
People who want an easy time-tracking focused on assigning role to day chunk.

# Needs

- Split work days and week-end in multiple chunks
- Define roles
- Define the chart goal - maybe with an option to set a minimal amount of hours
- track chunk

# Futher needs
- multiple devices
- have suggestion of how to spend time
  - define roles restriction on specific chunks - eg: no mapping or music on work day, for better suggestion
- on mobile app, could use notifications & quick response - a way to track chunks without opening the app

# Properties

To compare what roles are actualy used to what should be used, we need:
- know the amount of time used on each role
- know when this amount of time was used (allow comparison in a specific date range)

solutions:
track time by declaring activities, with accurate boundaries -> toggle
pros:
- accurante
- flexible
cons:
- cumbersome to declare accurante boundaries everytime

track time by declaring role on chunk
pros:
- give an idea on how to cut your day
- declare role tracking with ease
cons:
- cumbersome to edit chunk cutting (may use different template to remedy that)

Chunks properties:
- two chunks can't overlaps
- one chunk can only be before or after another chunk
