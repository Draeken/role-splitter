# Needs

- Display chunk on a timesheet
- Interact on limit to merge two chunks, move limit
- Interact on chunk to assign / split, move chunk (like moving two limits)

It looks like the range component, notable difference: two chunks share the same border.

Context: { from: number, to: number, role: UNDEFINED }[]
Top Component: startDate: number, days: number
Day Component: date: number
